    <H2>At Mommy's Kitchens, we’re serving up more Indian food. In fact, Mommy's Kitchens Famous korramenu is one of our unexpected specialties. Reminiscent of butcher shops back in the day, each slow-smoked, sizzling prime chop measures <br>seven-fingers high. Our signature recipe, that we have perfected for more than four decades, is rubbed with a secret blend of seasonings, cured and roasted on a rotisserie with pecan wood for up to six hours before it’s topped with <br>Mommy's Kitchens signature herb-garlic butter naan, then carved tableside.. <br>Join us!</H2>
